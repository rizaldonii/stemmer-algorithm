the canadians and danes boycotting american products penulis anne cassidy tanggal april link todd brayman is no longer buying his favourite red wine which is from california a veteran of the canadian armed forces he is one of a growing number of people in canada europe and other parts of the world who are avoiding buying us products due to president trumps tariffs and treatment of us allies i have in my life served alongside american forces it is just profoundly upsetting and disappointing to see where we are given the historical ties that our two countries have says mr brayman who lives in nova scotia but i think right now its time to stand up and be counted and in my mind that means buying local and supporting canadian business together with his wife mr brayman has replaced all the american products he used to buy including his previous wine of choice with canadian alternatives luckett phone box red wine which is from right here in nova scotia is great he says determining which products are canadian isnt always easy however sometimes labelling can be misleading adds mr brayman to help he now uses an app on his phone that can scan a products barcode and identify where its from if the product is identified as american the app suggests canadian alternatives the app called maple scan is one of numerous emerging in canada to help people shop local others include buy canadian is this canadian and shop canadian maple scans founder sasha ivanov says his app has had downloads since it launched last month he believes the momentum around buying canadian is here to stay lots of canadians have told me im not going back its important that we support local regardless he says canadians like mr brayman are boycotting american products in response to a raft of import tariffs introduced by trump these included tariffs of on all foreign cars steel and aluminium and tariffs on other canadian and mexican goods meanwhile other european union exports will get tariffs of while the uk is facing trump says the tariffs will boost us manufacturing raise tax revenue and reduce the us trade deficit however they have spooked global markets which have fallen sharply over the past month trump has even expressed a desire for canada to join the us as its st state something the canadian government was quick to strongly reject ottawa has also responded with cbn bn bn in counter tariffs as well as additional tariffs on the us auto sector and there has been a substantial drop in the number of canadians travelling to the us groups dedicated to boycotting us goods have also emerged in european countries momentum behind the boycott is particularly strong in denmark whose territory of greenland trump has said he wants to acquire denmarks largest grocery store operator salling group recently introduced a symbol a black star on pricing labels to denote european brands bo albertus a school principal who lives in skovlunde a suburb of copenhagen says joining the boycott was his way of taking action statements that trump made about wanting to buy greenland that was just too much for me he says i cant do anything about the american political system but i can vote with my credit card one of mr albertuss first moves was to cancel his subscriptions to us streaming services including netflix disney plus and apple tv my yearold daughter is a bit annoyed about it but thats the way it is she understands why i do it he says mr albertus is the administrator for a danish facebook group dedicated to helping people boycott us goods in the group which has members people share recommendations for local alternatives to us goods from shoes to lawnmowers mr albertus says its a movement that is quite a lot bigger than just our little country so it all that adds up mette heerulff christiansen the owner of a grocery shop in copenhagen called broders has stopped stocking american products such as cheetos crisps and hersheys chocolate in her store she is substituting them with danish or european products where possible ms christiansen is also swapping out products she uses at home shes finding some easier to replace than others cocacola is easy to substitute with jolly cola a danish brand she says but technology like facebook thats totally difficult to avoid she believes the boycott movement in denmark is helping people to channel their anger at trumps policies and rhetoric i think its more for the danish people to feel good that they are doing something she says douglas irwin a professor of economics at dartmouth college in the us who specializes in the history of us trade policy believes the economic impact of the boycott may be limited it is hard to judge how economically significant the consumer boycotts will be in terms of reducing trade with the united states he says in the past boycotts have not lasted long and have not achieved much it starts as a hostile reaction to some us action but tends to fade with time he says for now though the rising buy canadian sentiment in canada is boosting sales for many local brands the ceo of canadian grocer loblaw posted on linkedin that weekly sales of canadian products were up by double digits bianca parsons from alberta in canada is behind an initiative to promote locallymade goods called made in alberta which she says has had a surge in interest since the tariffs were introduced were now getting over hits to the site every two weeks ms parsons who is the executive director of the alberta food processors association adds ive had producers reach out to us and say im selling out at stores that i would never sell out before thank you so much several canadian provinces including ontario and nova scotia have removed usmade alcoholic beverages from their liquor store shelves in response to tariffs a move the boss of jack daniels maker brownforman has said is worse than tariffs among the american businesses feeling the impact is caledonia spirits a distiller based in vermont near the canadian border ryan christiansen caledonias president and head distiller says his business had an order on track for shipment to quebec cancelled directly after tariffs were announced my sense is that everyones just being a little too aggressive and unfortunately i think america started that says mr christiansen i do understand that the action america took needed a counter reaction if it were up to me id be at the table trying to resolve this in a friendly way and im hopeful that the leaders in america take that approach ethan frisch the cofounder of burlap barrel an american spice company based in new york which also exports to canada says hes more concerned with the impact of the tariffs on his companys imports and rising inflation in the us than the consumer boycott he says i think theres this assumption that if you boycott an american company its going to have an impact on the economy and maybe change the situation i think that assumption unfortunately is not accurate the us economy is crashing all up by itself businesses like ours are struggling without boycotts
