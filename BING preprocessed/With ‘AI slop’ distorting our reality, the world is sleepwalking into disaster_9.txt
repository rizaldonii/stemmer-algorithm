judul with ai slop distorting our reality the world is sleepwalking into disaster rilis april penulis nesrine malik sumber a perverse information ecosystem is being mined by big tech for profit fooling the unwary and sending algorithms crazy there are two parallel image channels that dominate our daily visual consumption in one there are real pictures and footage of the world as it is politics sport news and entertainment in the other is ai slop lowquality content with minimal human input some of it is banal and pointless cartoonish images of celebrities fantasy landscapes anthropomorphised animals and some is a sort of pornified display of women just simply being like a virtual girlfriend you cannot truly interact with the range and scale of the content is staggering and infiltrates everything from social media timelines to messages circulated on whatsapp the result is not just a blurring of reality but a distortion of it a new genre of ai slop is rightwing political fantasy there are entire youtube videos of madeup scenarios in which trump officials prevail against liberal forces the white house account on x jumped on a trend of creating images in studio ghibli style and posted an image of a dominican woman in tears as she is arrested by immigration and customs enforcement ice ai political memefare has in fact gone global chinese ai videos mocking overweight us workers on assembly lines after the tariff announcement raised a question for and response from the white house spokesperson last week the videos she said were made by those who do not see the potential of the american worker and to prove how pervasive ai slop is i had to triplecheck that even that response was not itself quickly cobbledtogether ai content fabricating another dunk on trump s enemies the impulse behind this politicisation of ai is not new it is simply an extension of traditional propaganda what is new is how democratised and ubiquitous it has become and how it involves no real people or the physical constraints of real life therefore providing an infinite number of fictional scenarios the fact that ai content is also spread through huge and ubiquitous chat channels such as whatsapp means that there are no replies or comments to challenge its veracity whatever you receive is imbued with the authority and reliability of the person who has sent it i am in a constant struggle with an otherwise onlinesavvy elderly relative who receives and believes a deluge of ai content on whatsapp about sudan s war the images and videos look real to her and are sent by people she trusts even absorbing that technology is capable of producing content with such verisimilitude is difficult combine this with the fact that the content chimes with her political desires and you have a degree of stickiness even when some doubt is cast on the content what is emerging amid all the landfill of giant balls of cats is the use of ai to create idealise and sanitise political scenarios by rendering them in triumphant or nostalgic visual language prof roland meyer a scholar of media and visual culture notes one particular recent wave of aigenerated images of white blond families presented by neofascist online accounts as models of a desirable future he attributes this not just to the political moment but to the fact that generative ai is structurally conservative even nostalgic generative ai is trained on preexisting data which research has shown is inherently biased against ethnic diversity progressive gender roles and sexual orientations therefore concentrating those norms in the output the same can be seen in trad wife content which summons not only beautiful supplicant homemakers but an entire throwback world in which men can immerse themselves x timelines are awash with a sort of clothed nonsexual pornography as ai images of women described as comely fertile and submissive glimmer on the screen white supremacy autocracy and fetishisation of natural hierarchies in race and gender are packaged as nostalgia for an imagined past ai is already being described as the new aesthetic of fascism but it isn t always as coherent as that most of the time ai slop is just contentfarming chaos exaggerated or sensationalised online material boosts engagement giving creators the chance to make money based on shares comments and so on journalist max read found that facebook ai slop the sloppiest of them all is as far as facebook is concerned not junk but precisely what the company wants highly engaging content to social media giants content is content the cheaper it is the less human labour it involves the better the outcome is an internet of robots tickling human users into whatever feelings and passions keep them engaged but whatever the intent of its creators this torrent of ai content leads to the desensitisation and overwhelming of visual palates the overall effect of being exposed to ai images all the time from the nonsensical to the soothing to the ideological is that everything begins to land in a different way in the real world us politicians pose outside prison cages of deportees students at us universities are ambushed in the street and spirited away people in gaza burn alive these pictures and videos join an infinite stream of others that violate physical and moral laws the result is profound disorientation you can t believe your eyes but also what can you believe if not your eyes everything starts to feel both too real and entirely unreal combine that with the necessary trivialisation and provocative brevity of the attention economy and you have a grand circus of excess even when content is deeply serious it is presented as entertainment or as an intermission in a sort of visual elevator music horrified by donald trump and jd vance s attack on zelenskyy well here is an ai rendering of vance as a giant baby feeling stressed and overwhelmed here is some eye balm a cabin with a roaring fire and snow falling outside facebook has for some reason decided i need to see a constant stream of compact cutesy studio apartments with a variation of this is all i need captions and the rapid mutation of the algorithm then feeds users more and more of what it has harvested and deemed interesting to them the result is that all media consumption even for the most discerning users becomes impossible to curate you are immersed deeper and deeper into subjective worlds rather than objective reality the result is a very weird disjuncture the sense of urgency and action that our crisistorn world should inspire is instead blunted by how information is presented here there is a new way of sleepwalking into disaster not through lack of knowledge but through the paralysis caused by every event being filtered through this perverse ecosystem just another part of the maximalist visual and show
