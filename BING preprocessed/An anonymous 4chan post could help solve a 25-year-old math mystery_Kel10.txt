judul an anonymous chan post could help solve a yearold math mystery tanggal terbit october penulis mary beth griggs link isi a chan poster may have solved part of a very tricky math problem that mathematicians have been working on for at least years the user was just trying to figure out the most efficient way to watch episodes of a nonlinear anime series but the result has generated considerable interest from mathematicians around the world who have no way to identify the anonymous user yesterday robin houston a computer scientist and mathematician tweeted about the bizarre intersection of chan and mathematics inadvertently setting off a wave of public interest in the story within hours of his tweet his phone was vibrating constantly it started to go mad he says my phone started going crazy the chan part of this saga began on september th when a poster posed a question if you wanted to watch episodes of the anime the melancholy of haruhi suzumiya in every possible order what s the shortest string of episodes you d need to watch if you wanted to watch episodes of haruhi in every possible order what s the shortest string of episodes you d need to watch there are episodes in the first season of haruhi a anime based on a series of japanese light novels the episodes which feature time travel and are otherwise chronologically challenging for the viewer originally aired in a nonlinear order when the series went to dvd the episodes were rearranged and it s become something of an obsession for fans to rewatch the series over and over again going through as many chronologies as possible an anonymous poster figured out one possible way to solve to the chan problem satisfying the more mathematically inclined haruhi fans but in the process they also helped puzzle out an issue that mathematicians have been working on since the anonymously authored proof which was recently reposted on a fandom wiki is currently the most elegant solution to part of a mathematical problem involving something called superpermutations it s an enigma that goes well beyond anime in mathematics a permutation is the order of a set of numbers in anime terms one permutation of haruhi would be watching all episodes in the order that they aired but what if you re a haruhi superfan and watching the season once isn t enough for you in that case you might be interested in a superpermutation or all of the possible permutations of a set strung together think of it as the ultimate haruhi marathon think of it as the ultimate haruhi marathon the branch of math that deals with permutations and superpermutations is called combinatorics it doesn t require years of study to be good at it either it s more accessible to amateur and casual mathematicians houston says the poster s anonymity doesn t invalidate the solution for the mathematicians what s beautiful about mathematics is that it s a proof that starts with your hypothesis and leads to your conclusion jay pantone a mathematician at marquette university says you have to convince a skeptical reader that you re correct that doesn t rely on your identity being known pantone was that skeptical reader for the chan proof this week he translated it from the more informal chan posting into a more formal layout that mathematicians like himself could more easily understand he says the proof holds up with the haruhi problem people were looking for the shortest possible superpermutation for the episode set but no one has found a formula that would actually solve that problem the paper suggested one part of that solution but in houston figured out that the math used in the problem didn t work for sets containing more than six numbers the result got mathematicians really excited about the problem again after it had languished in the literature for a quarter century eventually one of them found the chan proof and all those numbers and symbols started to fall into place the chan proof outlines how to find the smallest possible number of episodes for the solution but that doesn t fully solve the problem an even bigger breakthrough came earlier this month when scifi author and mathematician greg egan wrote up a proof that outlined how to find the largest possible number for any given superpermutation problem pantone crunched the numbers of the haruhi problem for the verge and found that you d need to watch at least episodes to watch the season in any possible order at most you d need to watch episodes to accomplish the task there s still a ways to go to narrow down the exact answer but they re getting there now mathematicians have a way to figure out the range of answers and a group of them including houston and pantone are actively working to figure out a formula that combines egan s work and the anonymous proof into a cohesive formula it might be possible to crack the thing completely open houston says beyond answering obscure anime questions there are no known applications for the formula beyond answering obscure anime questions there are no known applications for the formula which isn t unusual in the field it often takes decades pantone says for formulas that are discovered in pure mathematics to make their way into realworld applications but the chan episode does show that math can be accessible to anyone this proof shows that you don t need to be a professional mathematician to understand mathematics and advance the frontier of knowledge pantone says that s the beautiful thing about math is that anyone can understand the questions
