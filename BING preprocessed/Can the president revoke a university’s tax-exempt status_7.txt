judul can the president revoke a university s taxexempt status tanggal rilis april penulis zachary b wolf sumber cnn cnn s report that the irs is making plans to revoke harvard university s taxexempt status the day after president donald trump suggested it represents an unprecedented use of presidential power over the tax code while there are examples of colleges losing or failing to achieve taxexempt status this has never come on the heels of a president s express wish the irs is supposed to be immune from politics presidents aren t supposed to direct irs investigations us law specifically prohibits presidents from directing the irs to investigate anyone in a section entitled prohibition on executive branch influence over taxpayer audits and other investigations while the irs falls under the treasury department it s important that it be as protected from politics as possible that s why the irs has only two politically appointed officials according to mark mazur who was assistant secretary of treasury for tax policy at the outset of the biden administration the us has higher voluntary tax payment rates than other countries mazur told me because people feel that their interactions with the tax system are fair and based on law if the irs is suddenly used for political purposes that trust could be destroyed during the obama administration for instance the irs became embroiled in a bona fide scandal when a treasury department investigation found the irs delayed conferring taxexempt status on conservative groups if the irs did find that its taxexempt status should be revoked harvard would need to be warned and given an opportunity to contest the finding it would also have the opportunity to challenge the irs in court there is already a lot of chaos at the irs under the new trump administration multiple acting commissioners have resigned apparently the result a standoff over whether tax data could be used by immigration officials it would not be unprecedented for a university to lose its taxexempt status back in the supreme court agreed that bob jones university should not be taxexempt because at the time it banned interracial relationships among its students the university didn t drop its interracial marriage policy until in an announcement on cnn s larry king live coincidentally although it did not regain its taxexempt status until the us has now come full circle to the point that one of the main gripes trump has with harvard is its diversity programs harvard vs trump if there s one american university that should be able to stand up to the trump administration it s harvard the nation s most famous institution of higher learning has resources its endowment exceeds billion it also has allies a shocking number of republican and democratic lawmakers are alumni nearly of representatives and nearly of senators according to one estimate but for all of its wealth and cachet the institution relies on federal funding and its taxexempt status like every other major research university after harvard rejected the trump administration s demand for access to and review of harvard s employment hiring and admissions data as well as the discontinuation of all diversity programs trump said on social media that the university s taxexempt status should be rescinded the longterm question will be what would happen to harvard without federal dollars and exemption from billions of dollars it might owe in taxes if it lost that status not only to the federal government but perhaps also to the state of massachusetts why are universities taxexempt harvard along with most major public and private us colleges is exempt from paying taxes because of its status as a nonprofit organization like churches and charities universities fall under section c of us tax code the idea which is written into the law is that their benefit to society in this case education and research outweighs the need for the tax base they would provide not all institutes of higher learning go this route as trump is intimately aware his nowdefunct trump university was a forprofit organization that was sued for fraud by former presidents trump settled the lawsuits taxexempt universities on the other hand must refrain from endorsing candidates or influencing legislation among other things they must publicly provide annual reports on their activities and finances in harmony with the public interest the irs and the us have challenged the taxexempt status of universities and other organizations as occurred with south carolina s fundamentalist bob jones university the irs challenged bob jones status in but the supreme court didn t rule until that in order to be taxexempt an organization must demonstrably serve and be in harmony with the public interest and the institution s purpose must not be so at odds with the common community conscience as to undermine any public benefit that might otherwise be conferred for many years the irs withheld taxexempt status granted to religious organizations from the church of scientology but reversed course in after a long and unconventional campaign by scientologists trump has already taxed universities like harvard interestingly the tax law trump signed during his first term levied a new tax on the wealthiest universities including harvard the excise tax on universities with more than per student in their endowments applied to universities in according to the tax policy center and raised million that tax still exists today lawmakers are currently revisiting that law and it could provide another opportunity to take a hard look at the taxes paid or not by universities
