judul alexander fleming rilis april penulis science history institute link in alexander fleming discovered penicillin though he did not realize the full significance of his discovery for at least another decade he eventually received the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in as far back as the th century antagonism between certain bacteria and molds had been observed and a name was given to this phenomenon antibiosis but little was made of these observations a folk tradition using molds in medicine was similarly neglected in alexander fleming discovered penicillin made from the penicillium notatum mold but he did not receive the nobel prize in physiology or medicine for his discovery until fleming himself did not realize how important his discovery was for a decade after he focused instead on penicillin s potential use as a topical antiseptic for wounds and surface infections and as a means of isolating certain bacteria in laboratory cultures it was left to his fellow nobelists howard florey and ernst chain to demonstrate in that penicillin could be used as a therapeutic agent to fight a large number of bacterial diseases the road to st mary s born in lochfield ayrshire scotland fleming was the seventh of eight surviving children in a farm family his father died when he was seven years old leaving his mother to manage the farm with her eldest stepson fleming having acquired a good basic education in local schools followed a stepbrother already a practicing physician to london when he was he spent his teenaged years attending classes at regent street polytechnic working as a shipping clerk and serving briefly in the army during the boer war although he did not see combat then in he won a scholarship to st mary s hospital medical school in paddington london which remained his professional home for the rest of his life approaches to fighting infectious disease fleming accepted a post as a medical bacteriologist at st mary s after completing his studies and in he joined the staff of the inoculation department under the direction of sir almroth wright wright strongly believed in strengthening the body s own immune system through vaccine therapy not by chemotherapy the introduction of external chemical agents see paul ehrlich nonetheless he turned over to fleming samples of a new drug salvarsan synthesized by paul ehrlich and colleagues for treating syphilis fleming s experience administering the drug to patients was positive and thereafter he maintained a small but lucrative practice administering salvarsan to wealthy patients suffering from syphilis during world war i fleming worked at a special woundresearch laboratory in boulogne france headed by wright there he began research that produced results more in keeping with wright s thinking he was able to demonstrate that then commonly used chemical antiseptics like carbolic acid do not sterilize jagged wounds rather pus has its own antibacterial powers using cells on a slide he was able to show that chemical antiseptics in dilutions harmless to bacteria actually damage white blood corpuscles leukocytes the body s first line of defense after world war i fleming continued to work on leukocytes and antisepsis in he discovered a substance in nasal mucus that causes bacteria to disintegrate fleming and a colleague subsequently detected this substance which he named lysozyme in human blood serum tears saliva milk and a wide variety of other fluids in its natural state lysozyme seemed to be more effective against harmless airborne bacteria than against diseasecausing bacteria and attempts to concentrate it thereby strengthening its antiseptic properties proved unsuccessful penicillin discovered by accident fleming s legendary discovery of penicillin occurred in while he was investigating staphylococcus a common type of bacteria that causes boils and can also cause disastrous infections in patients with weakened immune systems before fleming left for a twoweek vacation a petri dish containing a staphylococcus culture was left on a lab bench and never placed in the incubator as intended somehow in preparing the culture a penicillium mold spore had been accidentally introduced into the medium perhaps coming in through a window or more likely floating up a stairwell from the lab below where various molds were being cultured the temperature conditions that prevailed during fleming s absence permitted both the bacteria and the mold spores to grow had the incubator been used only the bacteria could have grown fleming s laboratory notebooks are sketchy and his subsequent accounts of the discovery are contradictory the evidence of the first culture which he photographed indicated that he observed lysis the weakening and destruction of bacteria as in his lysozyme studies but sometimes he described the key observation as an instance of inhibition or prevention of bacterial growth in areas affected by the mold juice evidenced by a clear zone surrounding the mold although these two effects occur under quite different conditions fleming probably forgot which observation came first for in the months subsequent to the original observation he conducted many experiments while varying conditions systematically he discovered that the antibacterial substance was not produced by all molds only by certain strains of penicillium namely penicillium notatum although he could not isolate it he named the active substance penicillin he studied methods of producing the impure product and determined its stability at different temperatures and over various lengths of time he investigated its effect on many microbes curiously omitting the familiar spirochete that causes syphilis which salvarsan controlled but did not eliminate he tested its toxicity on a laboratory mouse and a rabbit forever after it has been a puzzle why he did not inject these or other laboratory animals with staphylococcus or other diseasecausing bacteria before injecting them with the fluid containing penicillin perhaps the explanation lay in his belief that cures come from within the body itself rather than from an external agent so he was not looking for a curative agent but rather focused on his new find as a topical antiseptic in later years he claimed that the difficulties he had experienced in isolating and stabilizing penicillin let alone the problems of producing sufficient quantities for clinical trials had prevented him from realizing the full fruits of his research in fact in the s little notice was taken by the scientific community of his paper published in the british journal of experimental pathology june those few scientists who sent for samples and tried to gain more understanding of the properties of penicillin did not or could not capitalize on fleming s discovery
