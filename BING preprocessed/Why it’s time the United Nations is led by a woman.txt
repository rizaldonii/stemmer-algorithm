judul why it s time the united nations is led by a woman with efforts towards gender equality stalling voting in a first female head of the un would provide powerful representation for half the world s population and be good for all of it rilis april penulis melanie beth oliver link thirty years ago the world saw an event that would sadly be hard to envision today representatives from countries endorsing a plan to improve the lives of women across the world the event was the united nations fourth world conference on women in beijing in september it was attended by almost delegates mostly women the beijing declaration as it came to be known recognized that gender equality is not only a human right but also transforms societies and enriches all lives huge strides have been made since women s access to education and reproductive health care has expanded maternal mortality has fallen from deaths per live births in to in the number of countries with laws that prohibit genderbased discrimination in employment has nearly trebled since to as of the proportion of women in parliaments has more than doubled in the same period although as of countries have still never had a woman serve as head of state or government according to a report published by un women see gonaturecomgonoj which was formed in in new york city as a source of funding and a driver of un activities on gender equality the beijing commitments also included a pledge to increase the number of women in research today of countries report on what they are doing to increase opportunities for girls and women in science technology engineering and mathematics as well as digital skills and training an increase from in the international day of women and girls in science established by un agencies in and held annually on february has helped towards that goal in education more broadly girls are now more likely than boys to complete secondary school in most regions subsaharan africa being a notable exception since the beijing conference organizations and businesses of all shapes and sizes along with un organizations have elected or appointed women to lead them one study found that as of women have been at the helm of un agencies there is however a glaring exception since its founding in the un itself has only ever been led by a man a campaign has begun to elect a woman as un secretarygeneral to succeed ant nio guterres when his second term ends at the end of there are several women equipped to do the job and it s time to hand the reins to one of them which is why nature fully endorses this movement the case for a woman to lead the un is grounded in principles of equality and justice and supported by scholarship peace agreements signed by women are more likely to last conflicts are settled more efficiently and equitably when women sit on both sides of the negotiating table and humanrights activists including advocates for women s rights have been very effective having a woman as un secretarygeneral as well as providing a role model would make it more likely that the unique circumstances of women such as being disproportionately affected by climate change and experiencing longlasting effects from conflict are factored into decisionmaking at the highest levels that decisionmakers need to be reminded that women are disproportionately affected is one indication that progress itself remains a work in progress indeed for the first time in decades some things seem to be going backwards the united states and elsewhere reproductive rights are being rolled back restoring the right of women and girls in afghanistan to receive an education and be able to work seems to not be a priority for the international community digital technology brings with it new forms of violence against women and girls and antirights actors are actively undermining longstanding consensus on key women s rights issues the un women report says since cases of conflictrelated sexual violence have risen by with women and girls experiencing of these crimes almost onequarter of country representatives to un women also reported that a backlash on gender equality is hampering implementation of the beijing declaration at the annual meeting of the un commission on the status of women in new york city last month governments reaffirmed and updated the commitments made in beijing including that nations look at societal and economic problems through the lens of gender however the united states and russia were among those expressing objections a marked difference to their broadly positive contributions in us representative jonathan shrier criticized the declaration for lacking specific language on gender arguing that women are biologically female and men are biologically male he also used the opportunity to denounce the un sustainable development goals there are reports that un women is among the groups under pressure from the us administration to avoid terminology associated with diversity equity and inclusion the organization has said previously that it is committed to the rights and equality of all people including women in all their diversity and all people with diverse sexual orientations gender identities gender expressions and sex characteristics appointing a secretarygeneral is complex the un security council dominated by its permanent members the united states russia china france and the united kingdom must agree on a candidate who is then put to a vote in the un general assembly the situation will be further complicated by the fact that the security council today is intensely divided that said surely no country today can argue that no woman is qualified for the role we are not saying appoint a person solely because of their gender rather we make this call to encourage un member states to overcome the biases that often mean that the right person is overlooked appointing a woman would send a strong message that years on from the beijing declaration the world s commitment to gender equality is not going away and that it benefits all people everywhere
