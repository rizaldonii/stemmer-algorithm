economies by the international monetary fund imf due to uncertainty caused by trade tariffs growth is now expected to be this year down from the imfs estimate of for the us in january the sharp increase in tariffs and uncertainty will lead to a significant slowdown in global growth the fund predicts the forecast for the uk has also been cut with the economy now expected to grow by this year but the imf has predicted uk economic growth will be stronger than germany france and italy inflation in the uk however will be the highest in the worlds advanced economies at this year largely due to higher bills including for energy and water the predictions come as top economic policymakers gather in washington for the spring meetings of the imf and world bank imf chief economist pierreolivier gourinchas said the global economy still bears significant scars from the severe shocks of the past four years it is now being severely tested once again he added on tuesday us president donald trump said he had no intention of firing federal reserve chair jerome powell after heavily criticising him concerns that trump may try to sack powell sparked a selloff in markets in recent days trump has made a flurry of announcements on tariffs this year taxes charged on goods brought into the us from other countries in a growing trade war the us has placed tariffs of up to on chinese goods while china has hit back with levies on us products the us has also introduced a tax rate on goods from the vast majority of other countries while pausing much higher rates for dozens of nations for days trump says tariffs will encourage us consumers to buy more americanmade goods increase the amount of tax raised and lead to huge levels of investment in the country however the imf highlighted the potential negative impact on global trade given that modern supply chains are so interlinked uncertainty around trade policy was a major factor behind the growth downgrades mr gourinchas said faced with increased uncertainty many firms initial reaction will be to pause reduce investment and cut purchases the imf predicts the global economy will grow by this year down from its previous forecast of and by in the downgrade to the us growth forecast was due to greater policy uncertainty trade tensions and slower than expected consumer spending the imf said tariffs are also expected to hit

said it expected a shallow recession in the us later this year with negative growth in the third and fourth quarters of china is expected to grow by this year down from the imfs previous estimate of in the uk the downward revision reflects the impact of tariffs higher government borrowing costs and weaker consumer spending as a result of higher bills and energy costs however the imfs prediction for the uk is now close to the growth forecast by the governments office for budget responsibility obr last month the imf expects the uk to grow by next year responding to the forecast chancellor rachel reeves said it showed the uk was still the fastest growing european g country due to reform which will drive up longterm growth in the uk reeves added that the world has changed and she would be in washington this week defending british interests and making the case for free and fair trade however mel stride the conservative shadow chancellor said the imf outlook was a worrying indictment of labours economic approach the imf has downgraded the uks growth forecast raising serious concerns about the lack of confidence and direction under labour they have also revised up significantly their forecast for inflation he said the imfs world economic outlook also contains the following forecasts the eurozone growth prediction is trimmed to for this year from it is then set to grow by in helped by higher government spending in germany spain is the only advanced economy to see its growth forecast upgraded to from this is partly due to reconstruction activity following floods canadas growth forecast for this year is cut to from reflecting tariff uncertainty and geopolitical tensions mexico sees the biggest downgrade it is now predicted to contract by this year compared with januarys forecast of growth forecasts are never perfect given the many factors that affect economic growth and the imf acknowledged its latest predictions had been particularly challenging the figures given are what the imf calls its reference forecast based on the situation as at april which was two days after trumps announcement of wideranging tariffs mr gourinchas said that while the reference forecast was the imfs central scenario many possible paths exist reflecting the unpredictability surrounding future trade policy and the varied impact of tariffs across different countries the imf also looked at the situation after the us temporarily suspended many tariffs while raising those on china sharply mr gourinchas said the tariff pause did not materially change the global outlook from its reference forecast because the overall effective tariff rate of the us and china remains high and uncertainty about the policy continues
