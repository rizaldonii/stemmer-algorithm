judul kierkegaard a brief introduction rilis april penulis robbie nama penggunapenulis di platform tersebut link this is a brief taster of kierkegaard after writing the heidegger article it struck me that the longerform articles are a bit of a time commitment for those uncertain about the value of heidegger and so i concocted the idea of boiling down what is most compelling about a thinker that way those who are new to a philosopher can read a short piece and decide whether or not they want to know more this is the trial run of this thought on the threshold of modernity the father of existentialism s ren kierkegaard was born in in denmarks capital copenhagen denmark at the time was standing at the threshold between the middle ages and modernity from this vantage point kierkegaard could see modernity from a perspective we can only dream of today he saw that the modern age wasnt just massproducing products it was massproducing people kierkegaard called this massproduced populace the crowd and from his earliest writings he attacked the media and the political and cultural tendencies giving birth to this population of living stereotypes this led kierkegaard on the philosophical quest for true individuality he railed against the dominant philosophy of his day the philosophy of georg wilhelm hegel hegels elaborate philosophical system promised absolute knowledge through a science of logic kierkegaard couldnt have disagreed more as the great presocratic heraclitus once wrote much learning does not teach insight and with that in mind kierkegaard called for a return to the living philosophy of the ancient greeks back then greatness wasnt merely about the books and knowledge you produced but the life you led for kierkegaard this became a creed philosophy must not exist in isolation from our everyday lives the christian existentialist but there was one crucial difference between kierkegaard and the ancient greeks he was a christian and for him this was an even more demanding ideal because this life was now the decider between eternal damnation and eternal salvation all these streams converged into one quest for kierkegaard how to become a true christian in christendom and in his eyes this had nothing to do with attending church or obeying dogma the central theme of kierkegaards philosophy is faith and for him this means far more than reading the words of the gospel it means living them it means action as we see with abraham faith is a personal experience between the individual and god and this experience transcends reason its a work that is never complete a choice you must constantly renew for kierkegaard this living repetition of faith is the making of the true individual since this faith transcends reason you wont find it in a book as hegel promised but you have to live it kierkegaard was acutely aware of the danger of massproducing a new breed of pseudoindividual replacing hegelians with kierkegaardians would do little for the cause of individualism and so to get around this he came up with a philosophical style he called indirect communication his philosophical model was socrates the irritating gadfly of ancient athens socratess stream of ironic questioning burrowed past the stereotyped answers of the culture without these easy answers he forced his conversational partners to think for themselves kierkegaard designed his style to do the same writing under twenty different names each with their own personality some admirable some scandalous kierkegaard forced his readers to think for themselves and to find their own individual faith thats everything for this brief taster of kierkegaard in the next instalment were going to do a deeper dive on the dane well be looking at his three stages of life the nihilistic aesthetical stage the responsible carryaheavyburden ethical stage and the ultimate religious stage well also give a more detailed look at what kierkegaard means by faith and his place in the existentialist movement
