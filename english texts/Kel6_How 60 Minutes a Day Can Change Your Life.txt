One Hour. 60 Minutes. 3,600 Seconds. We all have the same 24 hours in a day, but somehow, the idea of carving out just one hour to learn something new feels monumental for most people.
It’s strange when you think about it — one hour is the time it takes to watch a TV episode, scroll endlessly through social media, or mindlessly wander the internet. Yet, when it comes to dedicating this small sliver of the day to a productive purpose, many people just can’t seem to do it.
My question is: why?
The answer is nothing insidious, yet profound when you think about it: because one hour feels “optional”. It’s not part of the non-negotiables of our day like eating, sleeping, or working. It feels like time we should spend doing something, but we rarely do. Yet, if you harness that single hour every day, the impact can be radical. One hour is enough to learn a new skill, develop a passion, or build a foundation for something life-changing.
How do I know this? Because I’ve done it myself.
