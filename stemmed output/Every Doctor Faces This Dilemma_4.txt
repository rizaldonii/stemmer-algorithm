judul : everi doctor face thi dilemma rili : 20 april 2025 penuli : daniela j. lama sumber : http : //www.nytimes.com/2025/04/20/opinion/doctors-vaccines-patients.html my patient ’ s son took me asid late one even to share a request . i brace myself . my patient had been intub with covid-19 for week , her lung grow stiffer each day . her son held vigil at the bedsid , paus onli to critiqu the nurs and health care team . they didn ’ t like the way the nurs turn their mother . they demand yet anoth cours of antivir treatment for covid-19 . as their mother ’ s health worsen , their frustrat escal — and so did my uneas . the son pull a pill bottl from hi backpack . it wa a mixtur of herb that he had order off the internet . he want me give the supplement to hi mother through her feed tube , along with her other medic . i look it up onlin . there wa no evid that it would help hi mother — in fact it wa on a list of medic deem useless for the viru . at the same time , i suspect that my patient would not live through thi hospit , and i want to heal the relationship between the hospit staff and her famili . i told him that i need to confer with our pharmacist . but what i realli need wa time to consid my respons . if i acquiesc , it wouldn ’ t be for medic reason , but to tri to connect with an angri and distrust famili . i had to ask myself : is it ok to depart from the standard practic of medicin for the sake of build trust with patient and their famili ? it ’ s a question that is more relev than ever in thi polit climat , amid increas vaccin hesit and suspicion of medic profession . that moment with my patient ’ s son felt particularli fraught , but these sort of request are common and fall along a spectrum . doctor may agre to give their patient probiot becaus they are harmless , even though the evid for their effect is weak in most case . they might prescrib an unnecessari antibiot . they might even agre to spread out the time of pediatr vaccin at a famili ’ s insist .
