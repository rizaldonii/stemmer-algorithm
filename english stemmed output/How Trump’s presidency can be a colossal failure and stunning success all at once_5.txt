who convinc million that the fair elect he lost in 2020 wa a stitch-up . still , if trump somehow manag to secur a better deal for us manufactur with hi tariff war , he might justifi the mayhem he ’ s visit on financi market . if “ america first ” realli doe convinc europ to defend itself and the presid ’ s vow to forg peac work , the world may end up safer . but hubri is threaten an administr that

on which to base an attempt to simultan remak the global geopolit system and the world trade paradigm ; to transform the us govern ; and to destroy elit establish center of power . week ago , the washington narr wa that trump ’ s second-term team would be more disciplin and unifi than hi first . but that ’ s look increasingli threadbar . the presid badli need some swift win – not just those that reward hi maga base – to sustain hi credibl . backbit and organiz chao at the pentagon came after defens secretari pete hegseth confirm fear about hi fit for the job by post detail of militari

. that len is the best way to understand hi second term . musk ’ s depart of govern effici is the culmin of decad of conserv hope to dismantl the mighti feder machin . thi is not just an ideolog goal , although hostil to govern is one of the few common theme of two great gop code , reagan and trumpism . mani republican offici believ that the civil servic ha alway been a liber check on their presid

white hous seek – place trump on the side of the overwhelm major of american who didn ’ t attend ivi leagu colleg . if democrat chose to defend these bastion of elit , so much the better for trump ’ s
